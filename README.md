# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
Getting and Cleaning Data  | Final Course Project | Coursera

This is my course project for the Coursera course Getting and Cleaning Data.
The `run_analysis.R` in this repo does the following:

1. Loads the needed data into the working directory of R
2. Merges the training and test datasets
3. Extracts the mean & standard deviation
4. Labels the data with descriptive names
5. Creates a tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity & each subject.

The end result is shown in the file `TidyDataSet.txt`.
